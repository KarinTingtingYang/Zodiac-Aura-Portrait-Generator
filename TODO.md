# TODO: Zodiac Aura Portrait Generator
This file outlines potential improvements and features to be added to the Zodiac Aura Portrait Generator. Contributions and ideas are welcome!

## ‚ú® High Priority Enhancements
- **Image Download Functionality:** Add a button to allow users to easily download their generated aura portrait.
- **Refined Loading Indicators:** Implement more engaging loading animations (eg, a spinner or progress bar) in the overlay to provide better visual feedback during generation.
- **Comprehensive Error Messages:** Differentiate between various error types (eg, API rate limits, invalid input, internal server errors) and provide more specific, user-friendly messages.
- **Robust Input Validation Feedback:** Provide immediate visual feedback for invalid user inputs (eg, highlighting required fields if not filled).

## üöÄ Feature Backlog
- **"Try Again" / "Generate Similar" Button:** After generation, offer an option to generate another image with slightly varied parameters or the same inputs.
- **User Gallery/History (Requires Database):** Implement basic user authentication to allow users to save their generated portraits and view a history of their creations.
- **More "Vibe" Options:** Expand the selection of aesthetic vibes to offer greater creative control.
- **Custom Prompt Input:** Allow advanced users to directly input additional keywords to influence the AI ‚Äã‚Äãgeneration prompt.
- **AI Parameter Tuning:** Offer options for users to adjust AI generation parameters like strengthor num_inference_steps(with clear explanations of their effects).
- **Image Deletion (from ImgBB):** Implement server-side logic to store ImgBB deletion hashes and allow for the removal of uploaded images.

## üõ†Ô∏èTechnical Improvements
- **Frontend Accessibility (A11y):** Enhance accessibility features (eg, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
- **CSS Refinements:** Improve responsiveness across various screen sizes and refine the visual design.
- **API Rate Limit Handling:** Implement more sophisticated rate limiting on the backend to prevent abuse and provide graceful degradation when hitting third-party API limits.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Add more detailed server-side logging for better debugging and performance monitoring.
- **Containerization (Docker):** Create a Dockerfile and docker-compose.ymlfor easier local development setup and deployment.
